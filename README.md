# <b><u> âœˆ Travel Insurance Claim Prediction </b></u>
This is a 3rd capstone project dedicated for Purwadhika Data Science online class on the topic of Machine Learning using the use case of Travel Insurance Claim. The data is obtained from  [Data Travel Insurance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oube_R__QE9hs-MLxeWZXEeo4E1pDBLGwJs6efMomVU/edit#heading=h.ehz5tr8bo80).
<br><br>
In this project, our objective is to predict if customer is going to file for travel insurance claim or not. From the business perspective, we want to assess if the operation is going to keep the company running or not. We need to get the most profitable solution for the company.<br>
<br>
We are going to focus on reducing the amount of False Negative (Recall score) or the customer who predicted to not file for claim, but in actual filing for claim. This is a risk we need to reduce.<br>

In short, our analysis consisted of multiple steps as follows:
1. Problem Statement Understanding
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Analysis
4. Data Preparation (Feature Selection & Feature Engineering)
5. Modelling
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
7. Model Saving
8. Conclusion & Recommendation

From this sequence, we can get recommended actions and numbers comparison on the current sales strategy and the strategy incurred using the Machine Learning model. The final model that's determined as the best model out of all try-outs is Random Forest with NearMiss resampler.
